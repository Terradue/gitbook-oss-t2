# DotNet4One - .Net Library to Access XML-RPC API of Opennebula 

DotNet4One (Terradue.OpenNebula) is a library targeting .NET 4.0 and above providing an easy way to perform requests on any XML-RPC method exposed by an OpenNebula server.

XML-RPC API documentation: http://docs.opennebula.org/4.6/integration/system_interfaces/api.html

## Usage examples

```c#
// First create the client
string proxyUrl = "<YOUR_SERVER_URL>";
string adminUser = "<YOUR_ADMIN_USERNAME>"; //should be user with driver server_* to allow requests delegation
string adminPwd = "<YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD>"; //SHA1 password
var one = new OneClient(proxyUrl,adminUser,adminPwd);

// Do a request as admin
USER_POOL pool = one.UserGetPoolInfo();

// Do a request on behalf of a normal user
string targetUser = "<YOUR_TARGET_USERNAME>";
one.StartDelegate(targetUser);
int RemoteId = one.TemplateInstanciateVM(idTemplate, vmName, false, "");
one.EndDelegate();
