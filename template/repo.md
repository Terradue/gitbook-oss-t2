## Developer Cloud Service NEST Coregistration

The Next ESA SAR Toolbox (NEST) is a free and open source toolbox suite for reading, processing, analysis and visualization of SAR data. The toolbox is developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the GNU GPL license. 

This application performs the coregistration of a SAR stack.

### Getting Started 

To run this application you will need a Developer Cloud Sandbox, that can be either requested from the ESA [Research & Service Support Portal](http://eogrid.esrin.esa.int/cloudtoolbox/) for ESA G-POD related projects and ESA registered user accounts, or directly from [Terradue's Portal](http://www.terradue.com/partners), provided user registration approval. 

A Developer Cloud Sandbox provides Earth Sciences data access services, and helper tools for a user to implement, test and validate a scalable data processing application. It offers a dedicated virtual machine and a Cloud Computing environment.
The virtual machine runs in two different lifecycle modes: Sandbox mode and Cluster mode. 
Used in Sandbox mode (single virtual machine), it supports cluster simulation and user assistance functions in building the distributed application.
Used in Cluster mode (a set of master and slave nodes), it supports the deployment and execution of the application with the power of distributed computing for data processing over large datasets (leveraging the Hadoop Streaming MapReduce technology). 

### Installation 

Log on the developer sandbox and run these commands in a shell:

* Install **Java 7**

```bash
sudo yum install -y java-1.7.0-openjdk
```

* Select Java 7

```bash
sudo /usr/sbin/alternatives --config java
```
This will show on the terminal window:

```
There are 3 programs which provide 'java'.

  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
 + 1           /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_35/jre/bin/java
   2           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.5.0-gcj/bin/java
*  3           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java

Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number:
```

Select java 1.7 out of the menu options by typing the correct number (here it's *3*).

* Install this application

```bash
cd
git clone git@github.com:Terradue/dcs-nest-coregistration.git
cd dcs-nest-coregistration
mvn install
```

### Submitting the workflow
